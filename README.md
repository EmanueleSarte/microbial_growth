This project :electron: has been carried out by a group of Physics of Data student as final project of the course Laboratory of Computational Physics - Mod. B. The subject of the project and the supervision of the work has been provided by Prof. Carlo Albert. 

## Introduction

The aim of this project is analyzing data coming from microbial coltures by performing Bayesian inference of parameters belonging to stochastic models that describe the growth and the lifetime of the microbes themselves. The datasets used in this work are *Tanouchi25c*, *Tanouchi37c* and *Susman18*. 

### Formalism
The underlying idea that is shared by all the models considered for the analysis of the data is that a microbe can be described as a *dynamical system* characterized by a few dynamical variables $\vec{x}$
